####What is MeetMap?
Meetup is a single-page React.js web app that lets you discover Meetups happening around you by plotting them on a Google Map. Look at all the interesting things happening around you!

####What's under the hood?
* JavaScript and React.js for page rendering and interactivity
* Google Maps Javascript API for all things map-related
* jQuery for making AJAX requests to Meetup's API
* Bootstrap for layout & stylin'
* Gulp for automated builds
* Firebase for hosting

####Features
* Find Meetups based on your location and preferred search radius.
* MeetMap shows Meetups happening over the next 3 days (up to 30 will be returned).
* Click on a map marker to see details for that Meetup.
* Click on a green Meetup Panel (right side of page) to show its corresponding map marker.
* View the Meetup's page on meetup.com by clicking on the event name.

####What's next?
* Meetup API - Switch from API key signatures to OAuth for more interesting API queries (Meetup category, date, etc.).
* Google Maps - Show distance/route between user location and currently selected Meetup marker
* Database - Implement ability for users to save meetups (currently MeetMap is front-end only).
